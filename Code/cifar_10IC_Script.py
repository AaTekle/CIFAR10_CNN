# **Basic Image Classification**
Classifying labeled subsets of the 80 million tiny images dataset, collected by Alex Krizhevsky, Vinod Nair, and Geoffrey Hinton.

##**Image Classification Project Overview:**

## **Objective**:
This project focuses on training a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** model to classify images, such as images of airplanes, automobiles, birds, cats, etc.

## **Tools Used**:
We leverage [**tf.keras**](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/keras), TensorFlow's high-level API, which allows us to build and train models efficiently and intuitively.

### **Convolutional Neural Networks for CIFAR Project**

#### **Introduction:**

This project utilizes Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture for image classification on the CIFAR dataset. CNNs are a powerful class of deep learning models that excel in processing grid-like data, such as images, due to their inherent properties:

**Feature Engineering:** Unlike traditional neural networks, CNNs automatically learn and optimize filters (kernels) during training, eliminating the need for manual feature engineering. This allows the network to discover relevant patterns and features directly from the input data.

**Reduced Preprocessing:** CNNs require minimal pre-processing compared to other image recognition algorithms. This reduces the complexity of the overall pipeline and enables end-to-end learning.

**Regularization:** CNNs employ sparsity and weight sharing techniques, leading to fewer connections and regularized weights. This helps to reduce overfitting and improve generalization performance.

#### **CNN Architecture:**

The specific architecture of the CNN for the CIFAR project will depend on various factors, including the size and complexity of the dataset, computational resources, and desired performance. However, a typical CNN architecture for image classification often comprises the following components:

* **Convolutional Layers:** These layers apply filters to the input data, extracting relevant features and generating feature maps.
* **Pooling Layers:** These layers downsample the feature maps by applying pooling operations (e.g., max-pooling) to reduce the dimensionality and computational complexity.
* **Fully Connected Layers:** These layers perform non-linear transformations on the flattened feature maps to learn higher-level representations and ultimately produce class predictions.

This code uses the [CIFAR-10](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) dataset which contains 60000 32x32 colour images in 10 classes, with 6000 images per class. There are 50000 training images and 10000 test images.

The dataset is divided into five training batches and one test batch, each with 10000 images. The test batch contains exactly 1000 randomly-selected images from each class.

Between them, the training batches contain exactly 5000 images from each class.

"""###**Data Preprocessing: Preparing Images for Learning**

Before feeding the data into our CNN, we need to perform some essential preprocessing steps to ensure optimal learning and performance. This stage is crucial, it can significantly impact the accuracy and efficiency of our model.

Let's peek at the first image in the training set. You'll notice that each pixel's falls within the range of 0 to 255. While technically accurate, this format isn't ideal for neural networks. CNN's prefer data normalized to a specific range, typically between 0 and 1. This allows them to focus on learning complex relationships within the data rather than struggling with large numerical values.

Therefore, one of our initial preprocessing steps involves **scaling** each pixel intensity to fall within the desired range. This can be achieved by dividing each pixel value by 255. This simple yet powerful transformation ensures our data is ready for the neural network's learning journey.

**Why CNNs prefer 0s and 1s:**

* **Computational efficiency:** Numbers between 0 and 1 require less computation during training and inference compared to larger values. This is especially important for large datasets and complex models.
* **Improved Gradient Flow:** When using activation functions like ReLU, inputs between 0 and 1 ensure a smooth flow of gradients during backpropagation, facilitating faster and more efficient learning.
* **Reduced risk of exploding gradients:** Large values can lead to exploding gradients, where the gradient values become too large during backpropagation and destabilize the training process. Normalizing inputs helps prevent this.

**However, CNNs can handle non-binary data:**

* **Pixels in images:** Most images use RGB channels with values ranging from 0 to 255. CNNs can still effectively learn from these images by scaling them to the desired range (e.g., [0, 1]) during preprocessing.
* **Other types of data:** CNNs can be adapted to work with other types of data, such as audio signals, text data, and even medical scans. The pre-processing steps might involve different normalization techniques depending on the data type.

**So, the key takeaway is:**

* CNNs benefit from data normalized between 0 and 1 for computational efficiency, gradient flow, and stability.
* However, they aren't limited to binary data and can work with various data types after appropriate normalization.

"""### **Setting up the layers**

The basic building block of a neural network is the [*layer*](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers). Layers extract representations from the data fed into them.

Most of deep learning consists of chaining together simple layers.

**We are implementing a convolutional neural network (CNN) using TensorFlow's Keras API. This model is typically used for image classification tasks. Let's break down each component:**

***Sequential Model:***
tf.keras.Sequential creates a linear stack of layers. This means each layer has exactly one input tensor and one output tensor.

This code defines a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using TensorFlow's Keras API. The model is structured for image classification tasks, specifically configured for input images of size 32x32 pixels with 3 color channels (RGB). Here's a breakdown of its layers:

1. **First Convolutional Layer**:
   - `tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(32, 32, 3))`: This layer applies 32 convolutional filters of size 3x3 each, using the ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) activation function. The `input_shape=(32, 32, 3)` specifies the shape of input images.

2. **Batch Normalization**:
   - `tf.keras.layers.BatchNormalization()`: This layer normalizes the output of the previous layer, stabilizing and speeding up the training process by reducing the internal covariate shift.

3. **Max Pooling**:
   - `tf.keras.layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2))`: This layer reduces the spatial dimensions (height and width) of the input volume by taking the maximum value over a 2x2 pooling window. It helps reduce the computation and parameters, thereby controlling overfitting.

4. **Second and Third Convolutional Layers**:
   - Similar to the first layer but with 64 and then 128 filters, respectively. Increasing the number of filters allows the network to learn more complex features at each level.

5. **Additional Batch Normalization and Max Pooling**:
   - Applied after each convolutional layer to further stabilize learning and reduce the feature map sizes.

6. **Flattening**:
   - `tf.keras.layers.Flatten()`: Converts the 3D output of the previous layers into a 1D array, making it possible to feed it into the dense layers.

7. **Dropout**:
   - `tf.keras.layers.Dropout(0.5)`: Randomly sets 50% of the input units to 0 at each update during training, helping to prevent overfitting.

8. **Dense Layers**:
   - The first `Dense` layer with 128 units, followed by a final `Dense` layer with 10 units (presumably for 10 classes in the classification task), both using ReLU activation functions. The final layer outputs the class predictions.


This architecture is a common pattern in designing CNNs for image classification. The convolutional layers (with ReLU activation) are used for feature extraction, max pooling layers reduce dimensionality, dropout layers mitigate overfitting, and dense layers make the final classification decision. The model is well-suited for tasks like classifying images into different categories, such as the classes in the CIFAR-10 dataset. The increasing number of filters in the convolutional layers allows the model to capture more complex and abstract features at each level.
"""

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(32, 32, 3)),

    tf.keras.layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),

    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10)
])

"""### **Compiling the model**:

Before the model is ready for training, it needs a few more settings. These are added during the model's [*compile*](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/Model#compile) step:

* [*Optimizer*](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/optimizers) â€”This is how the model is updated based on the data it sees and its loss function.
* [*Loss function*](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/losses) â€”This measures how accurate the model is during training. You want to minimize this function to "steer" the model in the right direction.
* [*Metrics*](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/metrics) â€”Used to monitor the training and testing steps. The following example uses *accuracy*, the fraction of the images that are correctly classified.

              loss=tf.keras.losses.SparseCategoricalCrossentropy(from_logits=True),
              metrics=['accuracy'])

"""## **Training the Model:**

**Training the neural network model requires the following steps:**

1. Feed the training data to the model. In this example, the training data is in the `train_images` and `train_labels` arrays.
2. The model learns to associate images and labels.
3. We ask the model to make predictions about a test setâ€”in this example, the `test_images` array.
4. Verify that the predictions match the labels from the `test_labels` array.

### **Feeding the model:**

To start training,  we will call the [`model.fit`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/Model#fit) methodâ€”so called because it "fits" the model to the training data:
"""

model.fit(train_images, train_labels, epochs=10)

"""As the model trains, the loss and accuracy metrics are displayed. This model reaches an accuracy of about 0.75.8 (or 75) on the training data.

print('\nTest accuracy:', test_acc)

"""It turns out that the accuracy on the test dataset is a little less than the accuracy on the training dataset. This gap between training accuracy and test accuracy represents *overfitting*.
