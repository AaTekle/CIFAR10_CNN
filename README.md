# CIFAR-10 Image Classification with CNN

## Project Overview
This project focuses on building and refining a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for classifying images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. Our current model achieves an accuracy of approximately 67.7%, and we aim to improve this through various strategies and continuous enhancements.

## Dataset
The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. The dataset is divided into 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images. It includes classes such as airplanes, cars, birds, cats, etc.

## Model Architecture
Our initial model architecture comprises several layers:
- Convolutional Layers with ReLU activation
- MaxPooling Layers for downsampling
- Dropout Layers to prevent overfitting
- Dense Layers for classification

## Iterative Development
As we move forward, we plan to iteratively refine our model. This includes adapting to new findings, integrating cutting-edge techniques, and continuously evaluating the model's performance.
